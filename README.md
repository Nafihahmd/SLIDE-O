# Do More With SLIDE-O

- SLIDE-O is state of the art multifunction switch
- SLIDE-O can do much more in the same form factor of a regular push button
- Many ways to interact with SLIDE-O:
      
      - Surface Slide - Screen scroll
      - Gentle Tap - Select/Unselect
      - Tap Edges - Volume Up/ Volume Down
      - Press - Lock/ Unlock screen
      - Press and Hold - Power Off
- SLIDE-O can elegantly replace the power button
